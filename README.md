This app is a note-taking tool built using SwiftUI. 
It helps users to create, edit, delete, and organize their notes efficiently. Each note includes a title, content, 
and a completion status.

Summary of Functionalities:
1. Add Notes: Create new notes with a title and content.
2. Edit Notes: Modify existing notes for updates or corrections.
3. Mark as Completed: Toggle notes between "completed" and "incomplete."
4. Delete Notes: Remove unwanted notes from the list.
5. Persistent Storage: Notes are saved locally using a combination of AppStorage and JSON encoding, ensuring data is retained even after the app closes.
6. Navigation: Users can switch between note lists, details, and add/edit views.
7. Visual Indicators: Completed notes are marked with a green checkmark and a strikethrough.
